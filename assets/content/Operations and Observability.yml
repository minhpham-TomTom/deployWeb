Monitoring:
  Do you gather simple application metrics?:
    risk: Attacks on an application are not recognized.
    measure: Gathering of application metrics helps to identify incidents like brute force attacks, login/logout.

  Do you gather simple system metrics?:
    risk: Without simple metrics analysis of incidents are hard. In case an application uses a lot of CPU from time to time, it is hard for a developer to find out the source with linux commands.
    measure: Gathering of system metrics helps to identify incidents and specially bottlenecks like in CPU usage, memory usage and hard disk usage.

  Do you ensure targeted alerting?:
    risk: People are bored (ignorant) of incident alarm messages, as they are not responsible to react.
    measure: By the definition of target groups for incidents people are only getting alarms for incidents they are in charge for.

  Do you gather coverage and control metrics?:
    risk: The effectiveness of configuration, patch and vulnerability management is unknown.
    measure: "Usage of Coverage- and control-metrics to show the effectiveness of the security program. Coverage is the degree in \n        which a specific security control for a specific target group is applied with all resources.\n        The control degree shows the actual application of security standards and security-guidelines. Examples are gathering information on anti-virus, anti-rootkits, patch management, server configuration and vulnerability management."

  Do you gather defence metrics?:
    risk: IDS/IPS systems like packet- or application-firewalls detect and prevent attacks. It is not known how many attacks has been detected and blocked.
    measure: |
      Gathering of defence metrics like TCP/UDP sources enables to assume the geographic location of the request.
      Assuming a Kubernetes cluster with an egress-traffic filter (e.g. IP/domain based), an alert might be send out in case of every violation. For ingress-traffic, alerting might not even be considered.

Logging:
  Do you ensure a centralized system logging?:
    risk: Local stored system logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers or might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform a aggregation of logs.
    measure: By using centralized logging logs are protected against unauthorized modification.

  Do you log security events? :
    risk: No track of security-relevant events makes it harder to analyse an incident.
    measure: Security-relevant events like login/logout or creation, change, deletion of users should be logged.

  Do you have a visualized logging?:
    risk: System and application protocols are not visualized properly which leads to no or very limited logging assessment. Specially developers might have difficulty to read applications logs with unusually tools like the Linux tool 'cat'
    measure: Protocols are visualized in a simple to use real time monitoring system. The GUI gives the ability to search for special attributes in the protocol.

  Do you ensure centralized application logging?:
    risk: Local stored logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers with system access or might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform an correlation of logs. This leads attacks, which can be performed silently.
    measure: A centralized logging system is used and applications logs (including application exceptions) are shipped to it.

  Do you correlate security events?:
    risk: Detection of security related events with hints on different systems/tools/metrics is not possible.
    measure: Events are correlated on one system. For example the correlation and visualisation of failed login attempts combined with successful login attempts.
